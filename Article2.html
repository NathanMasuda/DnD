			<p>	Your character is the person you play in the story. Your decisions are influenced by the personality on the character sheet. It also contains the way you play the game.</p>
			<p>	In the sheet, there are classes and races. They describe how you play and what you are good with. The races are Tiefling, Dragonborn, Human, Half-elf, Elf, Gnome, Halfling, Half-orc, and Dwarf. Each one of these races has their own proficiencies, powers, and stat bonuses. The stat bonuses usually complement what class you are. The classes are Barbarian, Monk, Fighter, Ranger, Druid, Rogue, Paladin, Cleric, Bard, Warlock, Wizard, and Sorcerer. </p>
			<p> The classes determine what weapons and abilities you have. Classes like the Warlock, Wizard, Sorcerer, Cleric, Bard, and Paladin can use spells. </p>
			<p> The stats you get are determined by a dice roll with a D20. Some classes are better if stats are higher in a specific category. Your skills and saving throws are tied with your stats, but can be influenced by your race. Your hit points, armor class, and attacks and spellcasting are determined by your class, while your speed and features and traits are determined by your race. You also get to decide your personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. </p>
			<p> <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/rpg_playershandbook"> The Player's Handbook </a> will help you a lot when you create your character. There are a lot of other books that add different races to the game. These books are not required, but are recommended. </p>

			Dungeons and Dragons is a role-playing game. You play through a story told by the Game Master. The story and the game are driven by the decisions made by the players.
			<br>
			<br>
			You will need a group of people to play with to get started. One of the people will play as the Game Master, who is the storyteller. You will also need a campaign, which is the story that you play. You will need 7 dice: the D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, and D4. The numbers are how many sides are on the dice. Campaigns can span from a couple of hours to entire days. Having a weekly playing session can help manage the time. Lastly, you will need to create your character using a character sheet.

			Books like <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/rpg_playershandbook">The Player's Handbook</a> can help you get started with D&D. The book <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/marketplace/sourcebooks/dungeon-masters-guide">Dungeon Master's Guide</a> explains how to make campaigns. The <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/monster-manual">Monster Manual</a> lists all of the different animals you might encounter in your campaign. While these resources aren't necessary, reading them can enhance your game play and I recommend that you get them. </p>

	<p> Playing in a campaign is like reading a book. There are different places you go, allies you make, and villains that you must defeat. The only difference is that you can be in the story and change it. </p>
	<p> The Game Master will tell a story for you to play through. They can make you encounter different monsters that you must fight. Almost anything you do in the game is determined by a dice roll. If you want to attack a monster, you have to roll a die. If it is too low, the attack fails and your turn ends. You must also roll a die when you are talking to someone if you want to get information from them or other things like that. You can also get items the increase your power or help you in a different way. </P>
	<p> Your character will determine your strategy in the game. Different classes boost other playing styles, like a Sorcerer playing with magic or a Barbarian playing as a tank. Your stats will also affect your playing style. If you have high charisma you will be good at talking and having high intelligence will help you with problem solving. </p>
